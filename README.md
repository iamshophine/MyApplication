# Unobtrusive-Authentication-of-Smartphone-users-by-Context-Aware-Behavioral-Biometrics
  
## Objectives
   - To provide unobtrusive authentication for users using fusion of multiple behavioural biometric-based authentication
   - To provide the system with a trust score about the authenticity of the user to facilitate access control  
   
## Technologies Used
* Android
* Node.js
* R
